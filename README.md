- 👋 Hi, I'm [Xin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KBdTqoEAAAAJ&hl=en), a CSE Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).
- 👀 I'm interested in efficiently updating and improving LLM behaviors:
    - **Trustworthy NLP**: LLM interpretability
    - **Knowledge Management**: factuality and interpretability
    - **Music Science**: music interpretation and controllable music generation
- 🎓 I obtained the CS master's degree from Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Ningyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xQDOPvsAAAAJ&hl=en).
- :computer: I was fortunate to intern at Microsoft Research Asia, advised by [Xu Tan](https://tan-xu.github.io/).
- 🎵 I love music. I was a member of Wenqin Piano Society at Zhejiang University.
