- üëã Hi, I'm [Xin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KBdTqoEAAAAJ&hl=en), a CSE Ph.D. student at UCSD, advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).
- üëÄ I'm interested in
    - **Human-centered NLP**: fairness and toxicity
    - **Knowledge Management**: editing and low-resource acquisition
    - **Music AI**: generation, interpretation, and musician-oriented AI assistant
- üéì I obtained the CS master's degree from Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Ningyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xQDOPvsAAAAJ&hl=en).
- :computer: I was fortunate to intern at Microsoft Research Asia, advised by [Xu Tan](https://tan-xu.github.io/).
- üéµ I love music. I was a member of Wenqin Piano Society at Zhejiang University.
